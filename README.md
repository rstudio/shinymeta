# shinymeta

This **highly experimental** package provides metaprogramming helper functions and abstractions for use with Shiny. The goal is to make it easier to write Shiny apps that can generate standalone/reproducible R scripts or Rmd documents whose code generates similar outputs to what is seen in the Shiny app.

Some slides about the motivation can be seen [here](https://speakerdeck.com/jcheng5/using-shiny-responsibly-in-pharma?slide=5), though the solutions outlined in the post are precursors of the ideas in shinymeta.

For another experimental but promising solution to this problem, see [dgkf/scriptgloss](https://github.com/dgkf/scriptgloss).
