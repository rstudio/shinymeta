Once you're able to [generate code](code-generation.html) that replicates desired logic in your Shiny app, you'll need some way to distribute the code (and the results!) to users. **shinymeta** provides a few utilties to make all these things a bit easier to implement, including [downloading code and results](#bundles) as well as [showing code](#show-code) in the Shiny app itself.

<!--
One of the downsides to just showing code is that it doesn't guarantee the result will be reproduced, because the user may not have easy access to a suitable computational environment for running the code. One way to combat this is to provide both the code and the results as one deliverable. Moreover, by leveraging the power of **rmarkdown**, you can insert your code into a larger template that produces a high-quality HTML/pdf/word report of your user's Shiny experience. 
-->

## Downloading code and results {#bundles}

**shinymeta** provides helpers for generating [**rmarkdown** reports](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) from both R scripts (`buildScriptBundle()`) and Rmd templates (`buildRmdBundle()`). Both of these functions use code that you provide to produce a source file, then they (optionally) run `rmarkdown::render()` on that source file, compress the code & results into a zip file, and provide `shiny::Progress` indications to the user throughout all these steps. These functions are best used inside a `downloadHandler()` that's linked to either a `downloadButton()` or `downloadLink()`, so the user can generate and download these reports on demand.

### From an R script

The `buildScriptBundle()` produces an R script from a code expression. The default behavior is to call `rmarkdown::render()` on the resulting script, so to customize the resulting output file, you can leverage all it's support for [compiling R scripts](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rmarkdown/versions/1.13/topics/compile_notebook), such as including markdown and **knitr** chunks in special comments. You can also provide arguments to the `render()` call through the `render_args` argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinymeta)
library(ggplot2)
ui <- fluidPage(
  downloadButton("download_script", "Download script"),
  plotOutput("p1"),
  plotOutput("p2")
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$p1 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  output$p2 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = price) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  output$download_script <- downloadHandler(
    filename = "ggcode.zip", 
    content = function(file) {
      ggcode <- expandChain(
        "#' ---",
        "#' title: 'Some ggplot2 code'",
        "#' author: ''",
        "#' ---",
        "#' Some text that appears above the plot",
        "#+ plot, message=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, fig.show='hold', fig.height=2",
        quote(library(ggplot2)),
        output$p1(),
        output$p2()
      )
      buildScriptBundle(
        ggcode, file, 
        render_args = list(output_format = "pdf_document")
      )
    }
  )
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/mQ1kBAe.gif")
```

### From an Rmd template

If you need code spread across multiple chunks in a report, you'll have to use `buildRmdBundle()` instead of `buildScriptBundle()`, which requires Rmd template file. That template should contain one or more 'variables' surrounded in `{{}}` that match names supplied to `buildRmdBundle()`'s `vars` argument.^[Instead of using [parameterized reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) (i.e., the usual way to [generate downloadable reports](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/generating-reports.html)), `buildRmdBundle()` uses `knitr::knit_expand()` to fill in the Rmd template, so the user gets not only the report, but also the source file with the essential logic to reproduce that report.] For example, this template named `report.Rmd` has two variables, `{{plot1}}` and `{{plot2}}`, which we'll eventually supply with the code from `output$p1` and `output$p2`.

<pre>
```{r, results='asis', echo = FALSE}
cat(readLines(system.file(package = "shinymeta", "report-template.Rmd")), sep = "\n")
```
</pre>

Then, to use this `report.Rmd` template, the `downloadHandler()` in the Shiny app could use the code below (instead of `buildScriptBundle()`). Since our template places output code into separate **knitr** code chunks, it's a good idea to share the expansion context so that any dependency code isn't duplicated (as discussed in [code generation](#code-expansion)).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ec <- newExpansionContext()
buildRmdBundle(
  "report.Rmd", 
  file, 
  vars = list(
    plot1 = expandChain(output$p1(), .expansionContext = ec),
    plot2 = expandChain(output$p2(), .expansionContext = ec)
  ), 
  render_args = list(output_format = "all")
)
```

### Including other files

If your report needs access to other files (e.g., data files or images), you'll want to use the `include_files` argument. This copies local file(s) over to a (temporary) directory where the report generation and zip bundling occurs. More than likely, you'll want to use this to include a dataset that your Shiny app has access to, but your users probably don't. Below is a Shiny app where a user can upload their own dataset, then download that dataset along with some transformation of that dataset.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinymeta)

ui <- fluidPage(
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      fileInput("file1", "Choose CSV File", accept = "text/csv"),
      checkboxInput("header", "Header", value = TRUE),
      uiOutput("download_button")
    ),
    mainPanel(verbatimTextOutput("summary"))
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  
  data <- metaReactive({
    req(input$file1)
    read.csv(input$file1$datapath, header = input$header)  
  })
  
  output$download_button <- renderUI({
    req(input$file1)
    downloadButton("download")
  })
  
  output$summary <- metaRender(renderPrint, {
    skimr::skim(!!data())
  })
  
  output$download <- downloadHandler(
    filename = "report.zip", 
    content = function(out) {
      ec <- newExpansionContext()
      ec$substituteMetaReactive(data, function() {
        metaExpr(read.csv("data.csv"))
      })
      buildScriptBundle(
        expandChain(output$summary(), .expansionContext = ec), out, 
        include_files = setNames(input$file1$datapath, "data.csv")
      )
    }
  )
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/IV0gfZJ.gif")
```


## Showing code {#showicode}

### For an output 

If your Shiny app has lots of outputs, then you may want an intuitive way for users to obtain the code for specific output(s). For this purpose, **shinymeta** provides `outputCodeButton()`, which wraps an output in a container with a button. The button works in a similar way to an `shiny::actionButton()`, except the input is determined by the `outputId` of the shiny output it's overlaying: `input$OUTPUTID_output_code`. When this button is clicked, we recommend showing code for an output by supplying that code to `displayCodeModal()` (which shows a `shiny::modalDialog()` that contains a `shinyAce::aceEditor()`).
  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinymeta)
library(ggplot2)
ui <- fluidPage(
  outputCodeButton(plotOutput("p1", height = 200)),
  outputCodeButton(plotOutput("p2", height = 200))
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$p1 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  output$p2 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = price) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  observeEvent(input$p1_output_code, {
    code <- expandChain(quote(library(ggplot2)), output$p1())
    displayCodeModal(code)
  })
  observeEvent(input$p2_output_code, {
    code <- expandChain(quote(library(ggplot2)), output$p2())
    displayCodeModal(code)
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/ZiHKfXY.gif")
```


### For numerous outputs {#numerous-outputs}

If you want to show code for a collection of outputs at once, we recommend using a `shiny::actionButton()` instead of `outputCodeButton()` to trigger the code display. Note that with `displayCodeModal()`, you are able to control both the `modalDialog()` as well as the `shinyAce::aceEditor()` that it contains.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(shiny)
library(shinymeta)
library(ggplot2)
ui <- fluidPage(
  plotOutput("p1"),
  plotOutput("p2"),
  actionButton("code", "R code", icon("code"))
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$p1 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = carat) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  output$p2 <- metaRender(renderPlot, {
    qplot(data = diamonds, x = price) + ylab("Number of diamonds")
  })
  observeEvent(input$code, {
    code <- expandChain(
      quote(library(ggplot2)),
      output$p1(),
      output$p2()
    )
    displayCodeModal(
      code, 
      title = "ggplot2 code",
      size = "s", 
      fontSize = 16, 
      height = "200px",
      theme = "solarized_dark"
    )
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://i.imgur.com/h14d7QG.gif")
```
